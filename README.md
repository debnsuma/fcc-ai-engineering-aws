## 🎯 Overview

This course dives deep into the world of AI engineering, leveraging the power of AWS to build sophisticated AI systems. With a strong focus on Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), you'll learn to:

- Implement advanced RAG techniques using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/)
- Use different foundational models with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
- Create powerful multimodal AI systems capable of processing both text and image data
- Explore cutting-edge RAG techniques for enhanced information retrieval and generation with [OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/)
- Implement practical Multimodal RAG applications using AWS services and tools, like Lambda, DynamoDB, and more
- Evaluate and optimize AI model performance for production environments
- Implement Multimodal RAG with Vision Language Models using Colpali and Amazon Nova

Our course emphasizes hands-on experience with Multimodal RAG, enabling you to build context-aware AI systems that can understand and process both textual and visual information effectively.
